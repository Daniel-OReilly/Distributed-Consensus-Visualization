## Distributed Consensus Algorithm Visualization through Shiviz

* This repository contains the final project for CPSC 441, and CPSC 704
* The goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of Distributed Consensus algorithms, as well
as to create a visualization tool to aid future students in understanding Distributed Consensus.
* This was achieved through Message Sequence Diagrams

## Further Explanation

Distributed systems have become a cornerstone of modern software engineering due to their ability to be more scalable, cost efficient, and reliable. These benefits, however, come at a trade-off in increased design complexity as a result of the inability to use a synchronized global clock to timestamp events. To overcome this, one common method has been to use logical clocks as a way of capturing happened-before relationships; however, this causes no records to be kept related to when events actually occur. To combat this problem, this research aims to combine the benefits of both local clocks and physical timestamps to generate improved communication diagrams that help developers better understand their systems.
