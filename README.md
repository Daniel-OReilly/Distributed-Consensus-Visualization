## Distributed Consensus Algorithm Visualization through Shiviz

* This repository contains the final project for CPSC 441, and CPSC 704
* The goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of Distributed Consensus algorithms, as well
as to create a visualization tool to aid future students in understanding Distributed Consensus.
* This was achieved through Message Sequence Diagrams
